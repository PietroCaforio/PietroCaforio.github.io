I’m not entirely sure yet what I’ll be sharing, but this space will follow my PhD journey. It will probably start with brief summaries and reflections, and over time, I plan to post about papers I read related to Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) and NLP, as well as datasets, baselines, and code. I’ll also share discussions and thoughts on topics connected to my research and academic path.
