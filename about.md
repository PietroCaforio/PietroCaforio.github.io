Iâ€™m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland), within the **eXascale Infolab**.  
My doctoral work focuses on **Extreme Multi-Label Classification**: scalable architectures, label semantics, long-tail issues, and evaluation.

Previously I completed my MSc at Politecnico di Milano, where I worked on **missing-modality-robust multimodal learning** for oncology (radiology + histopathology).
